# Coding Challenges

Problems that tend to look easy once you know how to solve them...

For all of them, the solution is coded from scratch, with minimal reliance on existing libraries (exceptions: numpy, math, itertools). While considerable effort went into optimizing the computation (the brute force approach would often be considerably simpler to read), the code isn't particularly scalable - it's just a couple of methods, no classes and there are hardly any checks on whether the input is correct. Edge cases are usually taken into account, but not examples where someone enters a string instead of an integer.

Think of them as independent brain teasers to play around with, and keep in mind that many different roads can lead to the correct solution!
